    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Lisbon has one of the oldest histories in Europe, the city having been founded three thousand years ago. Along with Setúbal, Alcácer do Sal and some cities in the Algarve, it is the oldest in Portugal and after Athens, the oldest capital in the European Union. Lisbon is four hundred years older than Rome.
    Its history is linked to its strategic position at the mouth of the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula, the Tagus. Its natural port was the most comfortable for the replenishment of the ships that trade between the North Sea and the Mediterranean. It is also located in the southwestern corner of Europe, having been a strategic point for trade routes with Africa and America.</p>
